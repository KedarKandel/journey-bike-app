## Bike Journeys Visualiser Application

 This is a web application that allows users to visualise helsinki city bikes journeys,  stations and their detail information. The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is built using Node.js, Express, and Postgres.

- link to the deployed application: https://curious-panda-744db7.netlify.app/
- the deployed site is only taking few duplicate journeys data. Database hosted on render.com(free tier takes time for the server to spin)

- application is responsive


# Getting Started: 

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

 Clone the repository into your local machine: In your terminal write or paste this command "git clone  https://github.com/KedarKandel/journey-bike-app.git" and cd to journey-bike-app. You will have frontend and backend directories inside the journey-bike-app directory.

 In order to run this project on your local machine it should have node and postgres installed. 
 
 1. To check node, in your terminal type: node --version.
 2. To check posrgres, in your terminal type: postgres --version


 Head over to this webside to install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download 
                        install postgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

# Backend:
‚òëÔ∏èüò≥
-  I have deleted the information from all of the csv files inside          
   backend/csvToDatabase/data directory to push the code to github and make it clear to understand. If any problem exists connecting to the database.? You can delete those first.csv, second.csv and third.csv, and download and paste these three csv files inside the (data) folder.

    - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv
    - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv
    - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv


- replace the csv file heading of all three files with below line.(just the first line of each csv files). I did some refactoring.  

üëâ Departure,Return,Departure_station_id,Departure_station_name,Return_station_id,Return_station_name,Covered_distance_m,Duration_sec ü§èüèº



1. cd backend

2. Install all the required dependencies for the backend: npm install

3.  Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection in the .env file.

  - create a database called helsinkibikes or anything and mention this name in the .env file DATABASE = helsinkibikes and other env variables.

    * on terminal login to postgres: psql -U postgres
    * postgres query: create database helsinkibikes;

4. In server.js file, call the function loadData() only once  to avoid data duplication. 

5. Start the backend server: npm run dev
6. wait until "Data imported successfully!"
6. now comment back the // loadData() function. 

 * All set now for backend.
 * node express app will be listening at port 3001.

# Frontend:
1. cd frontend
2. Install all the required dependencies for the frontend: npm install
3. Start the frontend development server: npm start
4.  React application will be running at port 3000.

* The frontend of the application fetches the api data using axios library


The backend server will run on http://localhost:3001, while the frontend development server will run on http://localhost:3000.

# Features
